## NFTXSimpleFeeDistributor


Contracts and wallets can be excluded from fees through the VaultFactoryUpgradable contract. The owner of the contract can add an address, along with a boolean representation of their exclusion from paying fees, to the `setFeeExclusion` function. This will emit a `FeeExclusion` event and update an internal mapping. This can then be queried by other contracts by performing a call along the lines of `nftxVaultFactory.excludedFromFees(msg.sender)`.

Fees are charged and distributed when an NFT is minted, redeemed or swapped in an NFTX vault. If a user is excluded from fees in this manner then no fees will be send to the `feeDistributor` and no tokens will be transferred via the NFTX Vault contract.

This is used for NFTX zaps to allow for additional transactions to take place before, or instead of, incurring fees.

If fees are not excluded then:
- The amount of fee owed is determined by checking the vault fees that are assigned by itâ€™s creator
- The fee is then transferred to the fee distributor contract attached to the vault
    - This distributor is required during initialisation and its implementation is validated.
    - At this point the fee amount is also sense checked
- The distributor contract then calls the `distribute` function, along with the corresponding vaultId that is calling it
- Distribution logic will vary depending on the contract that is implemented. The different distribution contracts should have ample documentation and commenting to understand.

### distribute

```solidity
function distribute(uint256 vaultId) external virtual
```

Distributes fees to receivers. All receivers will be iterated over
to distribute their relative allocation of the total number of tokens.

The total balance of the token on the contract will be distributed.

Any dust balance remaining on the contract is transferred to the treasury.

_If distribution is paused or we have no receivers added (defined by
allocTotal) then the entire token balance will be sent to the treasury.

When our receivers are set up by the contract owner they are assigned an
`allocPoint` value that indicates the relative size of the allocation they
will be eligible to receive. This is explained in greater depth on the
`addReceiver` method.

The vault ID will determine the ERC20 token that will be transferred._

| Name | Type | Description |

### addReceiver

```solidity
function addReceiver(uint256 _allocPoint, address _receiver, bool _isContract) external virtual
```

Adds a receiver to the fee distributor. If a contract receiver is added, then they must
a call to `receiveRewards` as outlined in the `_sendForReceiver` function. The receiver is given
an `allocPoint` value that defines their relative stake of the rewards.

_For the point allocation, if receiver A has 1 `allocPoint` and receiver B has 3 `allocPoint`
then when rewards are distributed they will each receive a percentage based on the relative value.

For example, in this case receiver B would receive 75% of the rewards and receiver A would receive
the remaining 25%._

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _allocPoint | uint256 | The point allocation applied to the receiver |
| _receiver | address | The address of the receiver |
| _isContract | bool | Flag to determine if the receiver is a contract, rather than a wallet address |

### initializeVaultReceivers

### changeReceiverAlloc

```solidity
function changeReceiverAlloc(uint256 _receiverIdx, uint256 _allocPoint) public virtual
