## ERC165

_Implementation of the {IERC165} interface.

Contracts that want to implement ERC165 should inherit from this contract and override {supportsInterface} to check
for the additional interface id that will be supported. For example:

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override returns (bool) {
    return interfaceId == type(MyInterface).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
}
```

Alternatively, {ERC165Storage} provides an easier to use but more expensive implementation._

### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC165-supportsInterface}._
