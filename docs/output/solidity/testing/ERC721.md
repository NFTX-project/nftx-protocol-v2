```

_See {IERC721-safeTransferFrom}._

### _safeTransfer

```solidity
function _safeTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes _data) internal virtual
```

_Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients
are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.

`_data` is additional data, it has no specified format and it is sent in call to `to`.

This internal function is equivalent to {safeTransferFrom}, and can be used to e.g.
implement alternative mechanisms to perform token transfer, such as signature-based.

Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _exists

```solidity
function _exists(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool)
```

_Returns whether `tokenId` exists.

Tokens can be managed by their owner or approved accounts via {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.

Tokens start existing when they are minted (`_mint`),
and stop existing when they are burned (`_burn`)._

### _isApprovedOrOwner

```solidity
function _isApprovedOrOwner(address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool)
```

_Returns whether `spender` is allowed to manage `tokenId`.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist._

### publicMint

```solidity
function publicMint(address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual
```

### _safeMint

```solidity
function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Safely mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must not exist.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _safeMint

```solidity
function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes _data) internal virtual
```

_Same as {xref-ERC721-_safeMint-address-uint256-}[`_safeMint`], with an additional `data` parameter which is
forwarded in {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received} to contract recipients._

### _mint

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.

WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must not exist.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Destroys `tokenId`.
The approval is cleared when the token is burned.

Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _transfer

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Transfers `tokenId` from `from` to `to`.
 As opposed to {transferFrom}, this imposes no restrictions on msg.sender.

Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _approve

```solidity
function _approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Approve `to` to operate on `tokenId`

Emits a {Approval} event._

### _checkOnERC721Received

```solidity
function _checkOnERC721Received(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes _data) private returns (bool)
```

_Internal function to invoke {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received} on a target address.
The call is not executed if the target address is not a contract._

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| from | address | address representing the previous owner of the given token ID |
| to | address | target address that will receive the tokens |
| tokenId | uint256 | uint256 ID of the token to be transferred |
| _data | bytes | bytes optional data to send along with the call |

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | bool | bool whether the call correctly returned the expected magic value |

### _beforeTokenTransfer

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual
```

_Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
and burning.

Calling conditions:

- When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, ``from``'s `tokenId` will be
transferred to `to`.
- When `from` is zero, `tokenId` will be minted for `to`.
- When `to` is zero, ``from``'s `tokenId` will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
