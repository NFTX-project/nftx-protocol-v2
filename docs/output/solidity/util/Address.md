## Address

_Collection of functions related to the address type_

### isContract

```solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool)
```

_Returns true if `account` is a contract.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns
false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.

Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following
types of addresses:

 - an externally-owned account
 - a contract in construction
 - an address where a contract will be created
 - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed
====_

### sendValue

```solidity
function sendValue(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) internal
```

_Replacement for Solidity's `transfer`: sends `amount` wei to
`recipient`, forwarding all available gas and reverting on errors.

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884[EIP1884] increases the gas cost
of certain opcodes, possibly making contracts go over the 2300 gas limit
imposed by `transfer`, making them unable to receive funds via
`transfer`. {sendValue} removes this limitation.

IMPORTANT: because control is transferred to `recipient`, care must be
taken to not create reentrancy vulnerabilities. Consider using
{ReentrancyGuard} or the

### functionCall

```solidity
function functionCall(address target, bytes data) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Performs a Solidity function call using a low level `call`. A
plain`call` is an unsafe replacement for a function call: use this
function instead.

If `target` reverts with a revert reason, it is bubbled up by this
function (like regular Solidity function calls).

Returns the raw returned data. To convert to the expected return value,
use https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=abi.decode#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions[`abi.decode`].

Requirements:

- `target` must be a contract.
- calling `target` with `data` must not revert.

_Available since v3.1.__

### functionCall

```solidity
function functionCall(address target, bytes data, string errorMessage) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCall-address-bytes-}[`functionCall`], but with
`errorMessage` as a fallback revert reason when `target` reverts.

_Available since v3.1.__

### functionCallWithValue

```solidity
function functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes data, uint256 value) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCall-address-bytes-}[`functionCall`],
but also transferring `value` wei to `target`.

Requirements:

- the calling contract must have an ETH balance of at least `value`.
- the called Solidity function must be `payable`.

_Available since v3.1.__

### functionCallWithValue

```solidity
function functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes data, uint256 value, string errorMessage) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCallWithValue-address-bytes-uint256-}[`functionCallWithValue`], but
with `errorMessage` as a fallback revert reason when `target` reverts.

_Available since v3.1.__

### functionStaticCall

```solidity
function functionStaticCall(address target, bytes data) internal view returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCall-address-bytes-}[`functionCall`],
but performing a static call.

_Available since v3.3.__

### functionStaticCall

```solidity
function functionStaticCall(address target, bytes data, string errorMessage) internal view returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCall-address-bytes-string-}[`functionCall`],
but performing a static call.

_Available since v3.3.__

### functionDelegateCall

```solidity
function functionDelegateCall(address target, bytes data) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCall-address-bytes-}[`functionCall`],
but performing a delegate call.

_Available since v3.4.__

### functionDelegateCall

```solidity
function functionDelegateCall(address target, bytes data, string errorMessage) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCall-address-bytes-string-}[`functionCall`],
but performing a delegate call.

_Available since v3.4.__

### _verifyCallResult

```solidity
function _verifyCallResult(bool success, bytes returndata, string errorMessage) private pure returns (bytes)
```
