## ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable

_Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.

Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {nonReentrant} modifier
available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested
(reentrant) calls to them.

Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as
`nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry
points to them.

### _NOT_ENTERED

```solidity
uint256 _NOT_ENTERED
```

### _ENTERED

```solidity
uint256 _ENTERED
```

### _status

```solidity
uint256 _status
```

### __ReentrancyGuard_init

```solidity
function __ReentrancyGuard_init() internal
```

### __ReentrancyGuard_init_unchained

```solidity
function __ReentrancyGuard_init_unchained() internal
```

### nonReentrant

```solidity
modifier nonReentrant()
```

_Prevents a contract from calling itself, directly or indirectly.
Calling a `nonReentrant` function from another `nonReentrant`
function is not supported. It is possible to prevent this from happening
by making the `nonReentrant` function external, and make it call a
`private` function that does the actual work._

### __gap

```solidity
uint256[49] __gap
